# COVID-19 Data Exploration
This repository contains SQL queries used to explore COVID-19 data. The queries demonstrate various SQL skills, including Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Temporary Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types.

# Overview
The provided SQL scripts are designed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 across various countries and continents. They help in understanding infection rates, death rates, and vaccination coverage in different regions. The data used in these queries is assumed to be stored in two tables: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations.

Additionally, I have worked on visualizations in Tableau to enhance the analysis and provide a more comprehensive view of the data.

# Usage
+ Ensure you have access to the https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths dataset.
+ Copy and paste the desired query into your SQL query editor.
+ Execute the query to explore COVID-19 data as per your requirements.

These queries can be used for data analysis and visualization purposes to gain insights into the impact of COVID-19 globally. To further explore the data, you can view the visualizations I created in Tableau here.
